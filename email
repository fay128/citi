Hi Anna, Mattan

The fix of bug(b) has been merged and will deployed into UAT today. Will be tagged in snapshot and deployed again in UAT release on next Monday
For the APAC rollout user story (), the implementation is completed. Can we merge them into extractor's master branch later next week? 
The reason is to avoid the risk that this change will bring in in case we need more fix/commit for bug(b) when the OPS verify the fix in UAT.
According to David's plan, the SFE will start testing for the rollout of the 3 countries in Sep 30th so I think we still got time.
